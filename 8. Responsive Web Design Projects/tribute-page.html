        <label class="content-label">A LEADING VOICE OF THE GRACE REVOLUTION</label>
        <p class="content-paragraph">With more than two decades of full-time ministry behind him, Joseph Prince is today a leading voice in proclaiming the
        gospel of grace around the world through his books, teaching resources, and television ministry.</p>
        <p class="content-paragraph">The author of best sellers such as The Power of Right Believing, Destined To Reign, and Unmerited Favor, Joseph is also
        a highly sought-after conference speaker. He has impacted church leaders worldwide by preaching the unadulterated gospel
        of Jesus with boldness. He is known for teaching God’s Word in a fresh, practical, and revelatory way that always
        unveils Jesus. His humorous, dynamic and engaging style of preaching has also endeared him to a wide spectrum of viewers
        who tune in to his daily television program. His broadcast currently reaches millions of homes across North America,
        Europe, Africa, Australia, and Israel on both secular and Christian networks.</p>
        <label class="content-label">A FAITHFUL PASTOR TO HIS CHURCH</label>
        <p>A founding member of New Creation Church, Joseph initially served as an elder and associate pastor. However, his
        unanimous appointment as senior pastor in 1990 marked a turning point in the history of the church, which started
        experiencing phenomenal growth. Under Joseph’s leadership, the church congregation has grown by more than a
        hundredfold—from about 150 to more than 31,000 attendees.</p>
        <p class="content-paragraph">Having built and established the leadership and congregation of New Creation Church on the sure foundation of Jesus
        Christ, Joseph is now actively fulfilling, around the world, the mandate that God has given him to preach God’s
        unmerited favor without compromise. He heads Joseph Prince Ministries, Inc., an international, non-profit organization
        that seeks to build, encourage, and inspire people with the gospel of Jesus Christ through television broadcasting as
        well as new media technology. Joseph’s ministry as pastor, teacher, conference speaker, and author continues to
        transform many lives, setting people free from the heavy yoke of the law, guilt, and condemnation by pointing them to
        Jesus and His finished work at Calvary.</p>
        <label class="content-label">REVEALING JESUS TO THE WORLD</label>
        <p class="content-paragraph">Joseph believes the best in people and is committed to helping them discover how they can reign in life through the
        abundance of grace and gift of righteousness. His desire is to help this generation of believers understand the new
        covenant of grace and realize how greatly blessed, highly favored, and deeply loved they are by their heavenly Father.</p>
        <p class="content-paragraph">In addition, both Joseph and Wendy are moved by the plight of less fortunate children, especially in Asia, and consider
        it a calling and an urgent priority to provide practical help through Joseph Prince Ministries, Inc.’s missions
        initiative and humanitarian projects.</p>
